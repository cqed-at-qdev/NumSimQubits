# NumSimQubits

The goal of NumSimQubits repository is to provide introductory codes to support research at the Gyenis Lab at CU Boulder ECEE. The package is created by Andras Gyenis and built based on QuTiP 4.5. NumSimQubits is designed to provide access to the low-level numerical results to ensure easy developments and adjustments of the code.

The `numsimqubits` package contains two subpackages:

-`qubits`: collection of codes to numerical calculate the energy levels of various superconducting qubits.

-`dynamics`: collection of codes to simulate the time evolution of qubits and multi-level systems under external drives.

The examples in Jupyter Notebooks can be found on the projects github pages: https://github.com/gyenis-lab/NumSimQubits/
